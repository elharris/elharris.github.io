		<p>Hi, my name is Liz. I am a Graphic Design student at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. I have a strong background in Fine Arts but decided to study design. I knew it would help me to open my mind to new ways of thinking and problem solving. I am in my Junior Year at MassArt. I hope to further explore different mediums of design during my student career. I am very interested in learning more about advertising, interface design, app design, packaging design, print production. My goal is to enhance my understanding of design and see my work change and grow throughout time. I hope you enjoy my work. Thank you for viewing!
