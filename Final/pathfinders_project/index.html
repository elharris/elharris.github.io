		<p>This is a mapping project where I worked in a small team with three other students. We worked together to create a map that informs a user how to get from one point to another within and around MassArt campus. Our task was to create a set of visual instructions, a map, to move a hypothetical six foot sphere from point A to B with a few way points in-between. Our map needed to visualize time, distance, scale and other spacial properties. 

		We chose to try to find the most efficient route through the school and through exploring our campus grounds we began to understand how our map might look. Through sketching, digital drafts and user testing trials we came up with this map of visual instructions.

		Students included:
		Liz Harris
		Brendan McCabe
		Beth Almieda
		Maggie Edgar
